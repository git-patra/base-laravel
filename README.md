My CRUD Base Laravel

This base only for personal project, feature CRUD will be simple for me.
If you want to try this too, just clone it

How to:
- clone
- make model & migration
- make request with extend base request
- make resource with extend base resource
- make controller (simple, only construct 'optional')
- done.

You can see example on file <b>BlogController.
